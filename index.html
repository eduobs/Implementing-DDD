                        Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.<br />
                        Design is how it works.<br />

                        We strive to produce quality in the software we develop. We achieve some quality by using tests
                        to help us avoid delivering software with a fatal number of bugs. Yet, even if we could produce
                        completely bug-free software, that in itself does not necessarily mean that a quality software
                        model is designed. The software model—the <i>way</i> the software expresses the solution to the
                        business goal being sought—could still suffer greatly. Delivering software with few defects is
                        obviously good. Still, we can reach higher for a well-designed software model that explicitly
                        reflects the intended business objective, and our work may even reach the level of <i>great</i>.

                        The software development approach called <i>Domain-Driven Design</i>>, or DDD, exists to help us
                        more readily succeed at achieving high-quality software model designs. When implemented
                        correctly, DDD helps us reach the point where <i>our design is exactly how the software
                            works</i>>.
                        This book is about helping you correctly implement DDD.

                        You may be completely new to DDD, you may have tried it and struggled, or you may have already
                        succeeded with it before. Regardless, you no doubt are reading this book because you want to
                        improve your ability to implement DDD, and you can. The chapter road map helps you target your
                        specific needs.

                    <ul style="font-style: italic; color: grey;">
                        <li>Discover what DDD can do for your projects and your teams as you grapple with complexity.
                        </li>
                        <li>Find out how to score your project to see if it deserves the DDD investment.</li>
                        <li>Consider the common alternatives to DDD and why they often lead to problems.</li>
                        <li>Grasp the foundations of DDD as you learn how to take the first steps on your project.</li>
                        <li>Learn how to sell DDD to your management, domain experts, and technical team members.</li>
                        <li>Face the challenges of using DDD armed with knowledge of how to succeed.</li>
                        <li>Look in on a team that is learning how to implement DDD.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        What should you expect from DDD? Not a heavy, dense, ceremonial process that blocks your way to
                        progress. Rather, expect to use the agile development techniques you probably already have come
                        to trust. Beyond agile, anticipate the acquisition of methods that help you gain deep insight
                        into your business domain, with the prospect of producing testable, malleable, organized,
                        carefully crafted, high-quality software models.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DDD gives you both the strategic and tactical modeling tools necessary to design high-quality
                        software that meets core business objectives.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Can I DDD?</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can implement DDD if you have
                    <ul>
                        <li>A passion for creating excellent software every day, and the tenacity to achieve that goal
                        </li>
                        <li>The eagerness to learn and improve, and the fortitude to admit you need to</li>
                        <li>The aptitude to understand software patterns and how to properly apply them</li>
                        <li>The skill and patience to explore design alternatives using proven agile methods</li>
                        <li>The courage to challenge the status quo</li>
                        <li>The desire and ability to pay attention to details, to experiment and discover</li>
                        <li>A drive to seek ways to code smarter and better</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m not going to tell you that there isn’t a learning curve. To put it bluntly, the learning
                        curve can be steep. Yet, this book has been put together to help flatten the curve as much as
                        possible. My goal is to help you and your team implement DDD with the greatest potential for
                        success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DDD isn’t first and foremost about technology. In its most central principles, DDD is about
                        discussion, listening, understanding, discovery, and business value, all in an effort to
                        centralize knowledge. If you are capable of understanding the business in which your company
                        works, you can at a minimum participate in the software model discovery process to produce a
                        <strong><i>Ubiquitous Language</i></strong>. Sure, you’re going to have to learn more about the
                        business, lots
                        more. Still, you are on your way to succeeding with DDD already because you can comprehend the
                        concepts of your business, you revel in developing great software, and that gives you the proper
                        footing to take DDD all the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Won’t having years, even a decade or two, of software development experience help? It might.
                        Nevertheless, software development experience doesn’t give you the ability to listen and learn
                        from domain experts, the people who know the most about some high-priority area of the business.
                        You are at a greater advantage if you can engage with those who seldom, if ever, express
                        themselves using technical lingo. You’re going to have to listen and listen carefully. You’re
                        going to have to respect their viewpoint and trust that they know a lot more than you do.
                    </p>

                        <h4>There Are Big Advantages to Engaging with Domain Experts</h4>
                        You are at a greater advantage if you can engage with those who seldom, if ever, express themselves
                        using technical lingo. Just as you are going to learn from them, there is a high probability that
                        they are also going to learn from you.
