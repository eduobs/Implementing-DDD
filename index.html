                        Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.<br />
                        Design is how it works.<br />

                        We strive to produce quality in the software we develop. We achieve some quality by using tests
                        to help us avoid delivering software with a fatal number of bugs. Yet, even if we could produce
                        completely bug-free software, that in itself does not necessarily mean that a quality software
                        model is designed. The software model—the <i>way</i> the software expresses the solution to the
                        business goal being sought—could still suffer greatly. Delivering software with few defects is
                        obviously good. Still, we can reach higher for a well-designed software model that explicitly
                        reflects the intended business objective, and our work may even reach the level of <i>great</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The software development approach called <i>Domain-Driven Design</i>, or DDD, exists to help us
                        more readily succeed at achieving high-quality software model designs. When implemented
                        correctly, DDD helps us reach the point where <i>our design is exactly how the software
                            works</i>.
                        This book is about helping you correctly implement DDD.

                    <p>
                        You may be completely new to DDD, you may have tried it and struggled, or you may have already
                        succeeded with it before. Regardless, you no doubt are reading this book because you want to
                        improve your ability to implement DDD, and you can. The chapter road map helps you target your
                        specific needs.

                    <ul style="font-style: italic; color: grey;">
                        <li>Discover what DDD can do for your projects and your teams as you grapple with complexity.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        What should you expect from DDD? Not a heavy, dense, ceremonial process that blocks your way to
                        progress. Rather, expect to use the agile development techniques you probably already have come
                        to trust. Beyond agile, anticipate the acquisition of methods that help you gain deep insight
                        into your business domain, with the prospect of producing testable, malleable, organized,
                        carefully crafted, high-quality software models.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DDD gives you both the strategic and tactical modeling tools necessary to design high-quality
                        software that meets core business objectives.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Can I DDD?</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can implement DDD if you have
                    <ul>
                        <li>A passion for creating excellent software every day, and the tenacity to achieve that goal
                        </li>
                        <li>The eagerness to learn and improve, and the fortitude to admit you need to</li>
                        <li>The aptitude to understand software patterns and how to properly apply them</li>
                        <li>The skill and patience to explore design alternatives using proven agile methods</li>
                        <li>The courage to challenge the status quo</li>
                        <li>The desire and ability to pay attention to details, to experiment and discover</li>
                        <li>A drive to seek ways to code smarter and better</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m not going to tell you that there isn’t a learning curve. To put it bluntly, the learning
                        curve can be steep. Yet, this book has been put together to help flatten the curve as much as
                        possible. My goal is to help you and your team implement DDD with the greatest potential for
                        success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DDD isn’t first and foremost about technology. In its most central principles, DDD is about
                        discussion, listening, understanding, discovery, and business value, all in an effort to
                        centralize knowledge. If you are capable of understanding the business in which your company
                        works, you can at a minimum participate in the software model discovery process to produce a
                        <strong><i>Ubiquitous Language</i></strong>. Sure, you’re going to have to learn more about the
                        business, lots
                        more. Still, you are on your way to succeeding with DDD already because you can comprehend the
                        concepts of your business, you revel in developing great software, and that gives you the proper
                        footing to take DDD all the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Won’t having years, even a decade or two, of software development experience help? It might.
                        Nevertheless, software development experience doesn’t give you the ability to listen and learn
                        from domain experts, the people who know the most about some high-priority area of the business.
                        You are at a greater advantage if you can engage with those who seldom, if ever, express
                        themselves using technical lingo. You’re going to have to listen and listen carefully. You’re
                        going to have to respect their viewpoint and trust that they know a lot more than you do.
                    </p>
                    <h4>There Are Big Advantages to Engaging with Domain Experts</h4>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0px; font-style: italic; color: grey;">
                        You are at a greater advantage if you can engage with those who seldom, if ever, express
                        themselves using technical lingo. Just as you are going to learn from them, there is a high
                        probability that they are also going to learn from you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What you may like best about DDD is that the domain experts are also going to have to listen to
                        you. You are on the team just as they are. As strange as it may seem, the domain experts don’t
                        know everything about their business, and they are also going to learn more about it. Just as
                        you are going to learn from them, there is a high probability that they are also going to learn
                        from you. Your questions about what they know will most likely also uncover what they don’t
                        know. You’ll be directly involved in helping everyone on the team discover a deeper
                        understanding of the business, even shaping the business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s great when a team learns and grows together. If you give it a chance, DDD makes that
                        possible.
                    </p>
                    <h4>But We Don’t Have Domain Experts</h4>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0px; font-style: italic; color: grey;">
                        A domain expert is not one by job title. These are the people who know the line of business you
                        are working in really well. They probably have a lot of background in the business domain, and
                        they might be product designers or even your salespeople.
                        <br />
                        Look past the job title. The people you are looking for know more about what you are working on
                        than anyone else, and for sure way more than you know. Find them. Listen. Learn. Design in code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So far we’re off to a pretty reassuring start. Still, I am also not going to tell you that
                        technical ability isn’t important, that somehow you can get by without it. You will have to
                        grasp some advanced software domain modeling concepts. Even so, it doesn’t necessarily mean you
                        are going to be in over your head. If you have abilities somewhere between grasping Head First
                        Design Patterns [Freeman et al.] and grokking the original Design Patterns [Gamma et al.] text,
                        or even more advanced patterns, you stand a really good chance of succeeding with DDD. You can
                        bank on this: I’m going to do everything I can to make that happen by lowering the bar, no
                        matter what your level of experience.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What’s a Domain Model?</h4>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0px; font-style: italic; color: grey;">
                        It’s a software model of the very specific business domain you are working in. Often it’s
                        implemented as an object model, where those objects have both data and behavior with literal and
                        accurate business meaning.
                        <br />
                        Creating a unique, carefully crafted domain model at the heart of a core, strategic application
                        or
                        subsystem is essential to practicing DDD. With DDD your domain models will tend to be smallish,
                        very
                        focused. Using DDD, you never try to model the whole business enterprise with a single, large
                        domain
                        model. Phew, that’s good!
                    </p>
                    <p>Consider the following perspectives of the people who can benefit from DDD. I know you fit in
                        here somewhere:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>Newbie, junior developer:</i> “I’m young, with fresh ideas, I’ve got pent-up energy to
                            code, and I’m going to have an impact. What’s got me miffed is one of the projects I sprint
                            on. I didn’t expect that my first gig off campus would mean shoveling data back and forth
                            using lots of almost identical yet redundant ‘objects.’ Why is this architecture so complex
                            if that’s all that’s happening? What’s up with that? The code breaks a lot when I try to
                            change it. Does anyone actually understand what it’s supposed to do? Now there are some
                            complex new features I have to add. I regularly slap an adapter around legacy classes to
                            shield me from the goo. No joy. I’m sure there’s something I can do besides code and debug
                            all day and night just to finish iterations. Whatever that is, I’m going to track it down
                            and own it. I heard some of the others talking about DDD. It sounds like Gang of Four, but
                            tuned for the domain model. Nice.”
                            <br />
                            Gotcha covered.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>Midlevel developer:</i> “Over the past few months I’ve been included on the new system.
                            It’s my turn to make a difference. I get it, but what I’m missing are profound insights when
                            I’m meeting with the senior developers. Sometimes things seem whacked, but I’m not sure why.
                            I’m going to help change the way things are done around here. I know that throwing
                            technology at a problem only takes you so far, and that’s basically not far enough. What I
                            need is a sound software development technique that’s going to help me become a wise and
                            experienced software practitioner. One of the senior architects, the new guy, made a pitch
                            for something called DDD. I’m listening.”
                            <br />
                            You’re sounding senior already. Read on. Your forward-thinking attitude will be rewarded.

                        <li>
                            <i>Senior developer, architect:</i> “I’ve used DDD on a few projects, but not since landing
                            this new position. I like the power of the tactical patterns, but there’s a lot more I could
                            apply, with strategic design being one. What I found most insightful when reading [Evans]
                            was the Ubiquitous Language. That’s powerful stuff. I’ve had discussions with a number of my
                            teammates and management, trying to influence DDD’s adoption here. One of the new kids and a
                            few of the midlevel and senior members are jazzed about the prospects. Management isn’t so
                            excited. I recently joined this company, and although I was brought in to lead, it seems
                            that the organization is less interested in disruptive advancements than I thought.
                            Whatever. I’m not giving up. With other developers psyched about it, I know we can make it
                            happen. The payoffs are going to be much greater than anticipated. We’ll draw the pure
                            business people—the domain experts—closer to our technical teams, and we’ll actually invest
                            in our solutions, not just grunt them out iteration after iteration.”
                            <br />
                            Now that’s what a leader does. This book has lots of guidance that shows how to succeed with

                            <i>Domain expert:</i> “I’ve been involved in specifying the IT solutions to our business
                            challenges for a long time now. Maybe it’s too much to expect, but I wish the developers
                            understood better what we do here. They’re always talking down to us like we’re stupid. What
                            they don’t understand is, if it wasn’t for us there wouldn’t be jobs here for them to mess
                            around with computers. The developers always have some strange way of talking about what our
                            software does. If we talk about A, they say it’s really called B. It’s like we have to have
                            some sort of dictionary and road map on hand every time we try to communicate what we need.
                            If we don’t let them have their way by calling B what we know is A, they don’t cooperate. We
                            waste so much time in this mode. Why can’t the software just work the way the real experts
                            think about the business?”
                            <br />
                            You’ve got that right. One of the biggest problems is the false need for translation between
                            business people and techies. This chapter is for you. As you’re going to see, DDD puts you
                            and developers on level ground.
                            <br />
                            And, surprise! You’ve got some developers already leaning your way. Help them here.

                            <i>Manager:</i> “We are shipping software. It’s not always with the greatest result, and
                            changes seem to take longer than they should. The developers keep talking about some domain
                            something-or-another. I’m not sure we need to get high centered on yet another technique or
                            methodology, like it’s some kind of silver bullet. I’ve heard all that a thousand times
                            before. We try, the fad dies, and we are right back to the same-old same-old. I keep saying
                            that we need to stay the course and stop dreaming, but the team keeps hounding me. They’ve
                            worked hard, so I owe them a listen. They are smart people and they all deserve a chance to
                            improve things before they get torqued and move on. I could allow them some time to learn
                            and adjust if I can get backing from upper management. I think I could get that approval if
                            I can convince my boss of the team’s claims of achieving critical software investment and a
                            centralization of business knowledge. Truth is, it will make my job easier if I can do
                            something to inspire trust and cooperation between my teams and business experts. Anyway,
                            that’s what I am hearing I can do.”

                        Whoever you are, here’s an important heads-up. To succeed with DDD you are going to have to
                        learn something, and actually a lot of somethings. That shouldn’t be a big deal, though. You are
                        smart and you have to learn all the time. Yet we all face this challenge:
